# Project Intro 
This project implements the Pacman game using Python. Basicly, applied different searching algorithms on pacman game to let it find all food in maze with fewer steps. In addition, besides finding all food in maze, implemented other algorithms, letting Pacman agent play against the ghost agent and avoid meeting with ghost agent to earn higher score and win the game. The last but not least, applied reinforcement learning on Pacman agent to train it how to win against the ghost agent.
# Algorithms
